# chapter 2

Write one statement that declares an integer variable numHouses initialized to 25.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {

   #define numHouses 25

   cout << numHouses << endl;

   return 0;
}
```

Write a statement that increases numPeople by 5.
Ex: If numPeople is initially 10, the output is: There are 15 people. 

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
   int numPeople;

   cin >> numPeople;

   numPeople += 5;

   cout << "There are " << numPeople << " people." << endl;

   return 0;
}
```

Couldn't come up with a smartass answer for that;
